## Purpose, Language and Libraries
This is a test that I made accordingly with some given specifications. It is an App developed with Javascript and React JS, based on website and responsive designs.

It has two routes, the "home" and the "/users". The only way of getting into the user's route from the "home" view is by clicking on any of the two "Download" buttons that you will find on it. Once you are in the users' route, you will be able to see a list of users in the form of a paginated table, where you can see each user's full name and ID. You can see each user's profile by clicking on its name.
The user profile is a basic card that displays all the information about the user including first name, last name, email, and a picture. 

I extracted the data from a given API and fetched the information using React-redux and redux-toolkit because I think is easier to handle. The app has one store and one reducer.

I also utilized a couple of libraries. Here you can find the most important ones:
- DM Sans, Epilogue and Pridi as font families.
- Font Awesome icons
- Bootstrap for styles
- React tooltip
- Redux
